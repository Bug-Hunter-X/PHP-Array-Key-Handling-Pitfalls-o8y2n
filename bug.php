In PHP, a common yet often overlooked error stems from improper handling of array keys.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = "value1";
$myArray[1] = "value2";

echo count($myArray); // Outputs 2
```

While seemingly correct, this code demonstrates a potential pitfall.  If you later iterate through the array using `foreach` and rely on numerical indices (0, 1, 2...), you will only access `value2`.  This happens because PHP automatically converts string keys to integers when numerical keys exist.  The integer key `1` overwrites the implicit numerical index assigned to `key1`, resulting in the loss of that element during a numerical iteration.

Another example:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray[] = 1;
$myArray[] = 2;
$myArray["key1"] = 3;
$myArray[2] = 4; // overwrites the value of the implicit index 2
print_r($myArray);
//output: Array ( [0] => 1 [1] => 2 [key1] => 3 [2] => 4 )

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
  echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
//Outputs:
//Key: 0, Value: 1
//Key: 1, Value: 2
//Key: key1, Value: 3
//Key: 2, Value: 4
```

This unpredictable behavior can lead to bugs that are difficult to track down.
